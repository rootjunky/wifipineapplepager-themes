final fantasy theme by f3bandit

Status bar is disabled currently in the settings menu, And settings sub menus except for recon
as it's not needed in the main settings and afore mentioned sub menus. status bar may be re-enabled
later on as the theme is improved on. gps and mesh options should still be accessible thru the 
settings, You just may not see the icon on the dashboard on this theme, Until i get my gps 
and mesh modules. And I can plan where to still the icon for them.
